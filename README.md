# React To-Do List App 📝

🛠️ This project was built while following [Dave Gray's React tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6PrE9srvEn8nbhOOyxnWXfp). I adapted the concept from a grocery list to a personal to-do list and made small customizations to apply the concepts learned.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add tasks
- 🗂️ Search/filter tasks in real time as you type
- ✔️ Mark tasks as completed
- ❌ Delete individual tasks
- 💾 Data is saved in `localStorage` so it persists between sessions

## 🛠️ Built With

- React
- JSX
- useState hook
- Component-based architecture
- Props and prop drilling
- Browser `localStorage`

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

# This project helped reinforce core React concepts including:

- Functional components and hooks (useState)

- State lifting and prop drilling

- Managing side effects (like syncing with localStorage)

- Controlled input fields

- Real-time filtering logic

##🙏 Acknowledgements

- Inspired by Dave Gray's excellent React tutorial series

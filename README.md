# React To-Do List App 📝

This project was built following Dave Gray’s React tutorial step-by-step. I adapted the concept slightly by renaming it from a grocery list to a personal to-do list and made minor customizations.

This app serves as an educational practice to reinforce core React concepts such as state management, props, and component structure.
